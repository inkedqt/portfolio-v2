ALERT SUMMARY

MITRE ATTCK  
T1190 Exploit Public Facing Application  
T1059 Command and Scripting Interpreter  
T1059.004 Unix Shell  
T1505.003 Web Shell

WHO  
External attacker from IP 144.172.79.92 targeted PA-Firewall-01 at 172.16.17.139  
Source IP flagged as malicious on VirusTotal

WHAT  
Command injection exploit targeting Palo Alto PAN OS vulnerability CVE 2024 3400  
Malicious cookie used to inject shell command  
Payload attempted to execute curl command to attacker controlled server

WHEN  
Apr 18 2024 03 09 AM

WHERE  
PA-Firewall-01 Global Protect login endpoint  
/global-protect/login.esp  
Device telemetry directory under /opt/panlogs/tmp/device_telemetry

WHY  
Attacker attempted remote command execution via command injection vulnerability  
Goal was to force firewall to curl back to attacker IP and exfiltrate system information

HOW  
Malicious SESSID cookie contained directory traversal and shell injection  
Cookie value included curl command with whoami execution  
Logs confirm dt_send process attempted to send file using injected filename  
Outbound connection observed to attacker IP 144.172.79.92  
Curl execution failed due to DNS lookup error but command execution attempt confirmed

IMPACT  
Confirmed exploitation attempt of PAN OS command injection vulnerability  
Firewall executed injected command  
Outbound connection to malicious IP observed  
High likelihood firewall compromise

ACTION TAKEN  
Escalated as confirmed compromise  
Recommend immediate isolation of firewall management interface  
Block attacker IP at perimeter  
Rotate credentials and API keys  
Check for persistence mechanisms and unauthorized admin accounts  
Upgrade PAN OS to patched version  
Conduct full forensic review



CVE-2024-3400 is an unauthenticated command injection flaw in PAN-OS where a crafted request allows attackers to inject shell commands that get executed as root through the device telemetry component.”
