## 🎯 MITRE ATT&CK
T1190 Exploit Public Facing Application  
T1059.001 PowerShell  
T1046 Network Service Discovery

### 👤 Who
An external source IP 58.237.200.6 attempted to access Exchange Server 2 at 172.16.20.8 using crafted autodiscover requests associated with CVE-2022-41082 exploitation. AbuseIPDB shows the IP has been reported over 600 times for abusive scanning and brute force activity.

### 🔎 What
The attacker sent multiple HTTP GET requests to the autodiscover endpoint containing PowerShell indicators within the URL parameters. The requests attempted to access Exchange backend services including ews and owa paths. The presence of PowerShell in the request string is consistent with ProxyNotShell exploitation attempts targeting CVE-2022-41082. All requests were blocked by IIS.
