## 🎯 MITRE ATT&CK
T1546.008 Accessibility Features  
T1136 Create Account  
T1068 Exploitation for Privilege Escalation

### 👤 Who
Activity was observed on host Henry (172.16.17.149) where Utilman.exe was launched by Winlogon.exe and executed the command `net user superman onepunch123 /add`, indicating local account creation with elevated privileges.

### 🔎 What
An attacker modified the Windows accessibility binary Utilman.exe by renaming the original file and replacing it with cmd.exe. After rebooting the system, the attacker leveraged the accessibility feature at the Windows logon screen to obtain SYSTEM-level command prompt access. From this elevated context, a new user account “superman” was created and added to the local administrators group.

### 🕐 When
Jun 21, 2023, 11:02 AM

### 📍 Where
Hostname: Henry  
IP Address: 172.16.17.149  
File Path: C:\Windows\System32\utilman.exe  
Parent Process: Winlogon.exe

### 💡 Why
The attacker abused the Windows accessibility feature (Utilman.exe), which can be launched before authentication at the login screen. By replacing utilman.exe with cmd.exe, the attacker obtained a SYSTEM-level shell prior to user authentication. This allowed creation of a new privileged account without valid credentials, resulting in successful local privilege escalation and persistence.
